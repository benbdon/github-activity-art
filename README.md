### Acknowledgements
[Dan Bader](https://twitter.com/dbader_org)'s [blog post](https://dbader.org/blog/monochrome-font-rendering-with-freetype-and-python) helped me create stencil matrix from TTF fonts. Thank you Dan!

### First steps
1. Create and activate a `python3` virtual environment (optional). `python2` might work fine as well.

```sh
virtualenv venv --python=python3
source venv/bin/activate

```
2. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Just run `main.py` as a normal python script and answer the questions along the way!

```sh
python main.py
```

```

This is roughly how the activity graph would look like:

.......#..#....#.....#..##..........................
..##......#....#.........#..#....#..##...##...##....
.#..#.##..#..#.###..##...#..#.#..#.#..#.#..#.#..#...
